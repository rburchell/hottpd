/** Each server in the tree is represented by one class of
 * type TreeServer. A locally connected TreeServer can
 * have a class of type TreeSocket associated with it, for
 * remote servers, the TreeSocket entry will be NULL.
 * Each server also maintains a pointer to its parent
 * (NULL if this server is ours, at the top of the tree)
 * and a pointer to its "Route" (see the comments in the
 * constructors below), and also a dynamic list of pointers
 * to its children which can be iterated recursively
 * if required. Creating or deleting objects of type
 i* TreeServer automatically maintains the hash_map of
 * TreeServer items, deleting and inserting them as they
 * are created and destroyed.
