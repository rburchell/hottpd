mask or a server mask.

Valid WHO flags
--------------- 
The following flags after the mask have the following affects:
-
 o      Show online IRC operators matching the mask
 u      Unlimit the results past the maximum /who results value
        (IRC operators only)
 r      Show all users whose realnames match the mask. When this
        flag is set it overrides the meaning of the search-pattern,
        which must contain a glob pattern intended to match GECOS
        (realname) fields.
 h      Show real hostnames rather than masked hostnames (IRC
        operators only)
 m      Search for all users with a given set of user modes. When
        this flag is set it overrides the meaning of the
        search-pattern, which must contain the mode sequence to
        search for, for example to find all users with +i and
        without +s, issue the command WHO +i-s m.
 a      Show all users who have an away message matching the given mask
 p      Show all users who are connected on the given port number
 i      Show all users who have an ident (username) matching the given mask
 M      Show all users who have metadata attached to them with
        the given key name
